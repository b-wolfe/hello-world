Hello World Indeed!

So I'm one of those typical physicists who decided to get into programming.  I'm not particularly
great at it yet, but I'm hoping to develop some skills here.

Rust and Python are my interests.  I have a working knowledge of python and programming in general,
but I am probably missing some base knowledge that's holding me back.  Hoping to fill in the gaps
here.
